    <div class="overlay-text7"> <p>"Deep under this thicket, in places where the sun never shone, there lived birds and small animals. In calm weather you could hear the rustle of wings and hastily scurrying feet, but the animals never showed themselves." </p> </div>
    <div class="overlay-text8"> <p>"They stuck carefully to the narrow paths that wandered through the carpet of moss from one granite outcropping to another and down to the sand beach. Only farmers and summer guests walk on the moss. What they don’t know - and it cannot be repeated too often - is that moss is terribly frail." </p> </div>
    <div class="overlay-text9"> <p>"Step on it once and it rises the next time it rains. The second time, it doesn’t rise back up. And the third time you step on moss, it dies." </p> </div>
    <div class="overlay-text10"> <p>"Eider Ducks are the same way - the third time you frighten them up from their nests, they never come back. Tiny clusters of flowers would open at exactly the same height above ground and sway together in the wind, like inland meadows, and the whole island would be covered with a veil dipped in heat, hardly visible and gone in a week." </p> </div>
    <div class="overlay-text11"> <p>"Nothing could give a stronger impressions of untouched wilderness." </p> </div>
    <div class="overlay-text12"> <p>"But Grandmother sat in the magic forest and carved outlandish animals. She cut them from branches and driftwood and gave them paws and faces, but she only hinted at what they looked like and never made them too distinct. They retained their wooden souls, and the curve of their backs and legs had enigmatic shape of growth itself and remained a part of the decaying forests." </p> </div>
    <div class="overlay-text13"> <p>"Sometimes they were only a profile in the shadows, and sometimes there were two or three together, entwined in battle or in love. Grandmother worked only in old wood that had already found its form. That is, she saw and selected those pieces of wood that expressed what she wanted them to say." </p> </div>
    <div class="overlay-text14"> <p>"And so the wooden animals were allowed to vanish into their forest. The arabesques sank into the ground and turned green with moss, and the trees slipped deeper and deeper into each other’s arms as time went by. " </p> </div>
    <div class="overlay-text15"> <p>"Grandmother often went to the magic forest when the sun went down. But in the daytime she sat on the veranda steps and made boats of bark. " </p> </div>
