        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Hi hello!</p>
        <p>I am a Graphic Designer and Illustrator born and raised in Oahu, Hawaii. I am currently pursuing my BFA in Graphic Design at Western Washington University (WWU) in Bellingham WA. I enjoy developing brand identities, illustrating, as well as creating 2D motion graphics. 
            Professionally, I work as a designer for my university's primary interdisciplinary academic student journal, within this role I am tasked with the responsibility to design and illustrate these submissions for journals in a way to be accessible to all students and faculty at WWU regardless of their academic background. As someone who was raised in a multicultural household in a melting pot state I enjoy celebrating various cultures within my graphic design,  2D animation and illustration. I like helping people and achieving solutions via purposeful design and meaningful aesthetic choices while keeping accessibility in mind.</p>
        <p>Apart from design, I enjoy delving into the intricacies of medieval knight armor, getting too invested in Eurovision, and being in the open ocean!</p>
