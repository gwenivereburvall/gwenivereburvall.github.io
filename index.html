        <p>Hi hello! My name is Gwenivere Burvall. I'm a graphic designer and illustator born and raised in O'ahu, Hawai'i. I am currently pursuing my BFA in Graphic Design at Western Washington University in Bellingham WA. I enjoy developing brand identities, illustrating, as well as creating 2D motion graphics.</p>
        <p>Apart from design, I enjoy delving into the intricacies of medieval knight armor, getting too invested in Eurovision, and being in the the open ocean. </p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by my portfolio. I would love to collaborate and create something lovely together!</p>
